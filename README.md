# ER-diagram---Store-Management
The ER diagram for the store management system models the entities and their relationships within the system. 
Entities typically include 'Stores', 'Employee', 'Associative', 'Vendors' and 'Products' each with their respective attributes. 

Here's a brief overview of each entity:

- Stores: Represents the physical locations where products are sold. Attributes might include store ID, location, size, etc.

- Employees: Refers to individuals working within the stores. Attributes may include employee ID, name, position, etc.

- Associative: This entity likely represents a bridge table between other entities, facilitating many-to-many relationships. Its attributes would include foreign keys linking to other entities.

- Vendors: Represents companies or individuals who supply products to the stores. Attributes could include vendor ID, name, contact information, etc.

- Products: Refers to the items sold in the stores. Attributes might include product ID, name, price, quantity, etc.

The relationships between these entities would be depicted in the ER diagram, such as:

- Employees work at Stores (one-to-many relationship)
  
- Products are supplied by Vendors (one-to-many relationship)
  
- Employees may interact with Products (potentially through the Associative entity)
  
- Stores purchase Products from Vendors (many-to-many relationship, possibly through the Associative entity)
  
Each entity's attributes and relationships would be defined to accurately reflect the structure and functionality of the store management system.
